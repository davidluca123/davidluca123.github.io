  <p>
    I have been developing a cell phone based water diagnosis technology. By collecting microscopy data on
    microbes from the internet and in person, I have created a dataset of harmful waterborne microbes. Using this dataset,
    I developed and trained an image recognition model to identify disease causing microbes. Combining this program with
    a glass bead microscope attachment that can magnify images up to 1000x, I created a water testing technology that can
    determine the presence of harmful microbes in water by having the user simply take an image of their water. By counting the
    density of microbes and indentifying the microbe type in the water, my program also suggests possible tratment methods for the water
    as different microbes and different densities of microbes in the water require different treatment procedures. Furthermore, using location
    data, I also create a live map of clean and dirty water sources that is powered by the crowdsourcing of water testing using my technology.
    This information is invaluable for NGOs and goverments of developing contries, allowing them to pinpoint the disinfection of water.

  <i> Synthesized FeNC catalysts samples (top left and center). Mechanism of forming FeNC active sites (top right). RDE and BET analysis results (bottom). The halfway potential of my synthesized sample is observed to be 0.74V.</i>
  <p>
    I conducted research in Professor Hubert Gasteiger's lab at the Technical University of Munich,
    synthesizing one of the world's most active FeNC (iron and nitrogen doped carbon) catalysts for
    Oxygen Reduction Reactions for Fuel Cells. In our bodies heme proteins in cytochrome c is used
    to oxidize oxygen into water. These heme proteins have a FeN4 coordinated structure as its active site.
    With this active site in mind, I helped develop the synthesis of specific FeN4 active site in FeNC catalysts,
    biomimetic of heme proteins. In my synthesis, I also optimized mass transport in the catalyst by creating
    hierarchical pore structures in the catalyst. The synthesis technique that I helped develop is
    both simple and produces one of the most active non-noble metal catalysts for oxygen reduction
    and is now under patent process.

  <i>Screening of peroxidase null Streptomyces that took up the antibiotic cassette</i>
  <p>
    I started conducting research at the Sello Lab at Brown University in the beginning of June 2017. I disrupted
    the peroxidase gene in <i>Streptomyces</i> (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> model) bacteria through PCR Targeting and observed
    reduced bacterial resistance towards cumene hydroperoxide stress, a naturally produced molecule by the immune system.
    Additionally, I have also disrupted the cyclic AMP gene in Streptomyces bacterial and conducted <i>in vitro</i> well microplate
    antimicrobial drug susceptibility tests via resazurin microtiter assay.

  <center><b>Nanoparticle Synthesis and Catalytic Design</b></center>
  <p>
    I joined the Sun Lab in the beginning of September 2017 and began by synthesizing monodisperse silver palladium and iron oxide
    nanoparticles for formic acid dehydrogenation. I am currently developing iron palladium nanoparticles for catalysis of dechlorination
    reactions, allowing it to be run at safe pressures and temperatures. To analyze the synthesized nanoparticles, I conduct organic reactions,
    testing their stability and catalytic ability, along with ICP spectroscopy, TEM, and X-Ray Diffraction to analyze their physical properties.

  <i> Testing of our first prototype, The Pursuit.</i>
  <p>
    At the beginning of 2017, I helped start Cloud Agronomics, a solar powered UAV and
    data acquisition company, using our self-designed solar UAV and proprietary imaging technology
    for real time agricultural mapping that can provide instant data on crop health. We are also
    aiming to break the world record for the longest flight of a UAV under 50 lb, currently held by
    AtlantikSolar at 81 hours. We were selected as finalists for the Hult competition, finalists for the Get Started Rhode Island Pitch Competition,
    placed second in the Brown Venture Prize, awarded first runner up for the Startup Storm Global Business Plan Competition, and third in the Inaugural
    Penn Aerospace Pitch Competition. We have been awarded the Brown Maker Grant, Brown Explore Grant,
    and are working with the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society and are currently in a partnership with US Solar Works.
    We also currently have advisors at Brown, NASA, Boeing, and Stanford.

  <i> First prototype of Louis.</i>
  <p>
    I created Louis, a visually impaired assistant, that outputs an analysis of one's immediate surroundings in braille.
    It uses a raspberry pi to take images of one's sarroundings. We then use Google Cloud Vision to get an analysis of
    the images taken. This analysis is then and outputted into braille using the dynamic braille machine I designed.
    The braille machine uses two stepper motors that can both traverse through the
    braille blocks and also rotate them, creating a combination of letters and signals.

  <i> Homepage of NewsMap and projected news articles of Nasdaq around the world</i>
  <p>
    At HackMIT, I helped develop NewsMap.
    NewsMap utilizes global market visualization software to provide a real-time visualization of news reports mentioning companies across the world in over 65 languages.
    By customizing the tone and geographic data from these news reports, NewsMap provides simple, easily understood, and interactive graphics, representing historical and up-to-date data, along with a company's stock and financial performance metrics.
    This allows companies to quickly get fast, and reliable data on their international digital footprint, empowering them to make strategic and rewarding decisions.
    NewsMap won the award for best data visualization at HackMIT. You can visit Newsmap <a href="https://newsmap2017.herokuapp.com/">here</a>

  <i> The first ever findings of a crystal structure in-between the liquid gas interface and brownian motion observations in in liquid and gas. </i>
  <p>
    I started conducting nanoimaging research under the guidance of Dr. Gary Ren during the summer
    of 2014 at the Molecular Foundry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We developed a microchamber
    that allowed us to observe the first ever visualization of phase changes, the liquid gas interface,
    and brownian motion at the mesoscale. Using EMAN, I also analyzed phase and particle properties by tracking particle movement
    and calculating each particle's mean square displacement, speed, acceleration, and forces causing its movement. Our work
    has been submitted to <i>Physical Reviews Fluids</i> and is now under review. I was also awarded as a Siemens Semifinalist for this project.
